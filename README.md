# Project_3_Team5
Data Visualization Track about people murdered in Mexico over the last 5 years

This project delves into the profiles of homicide victims in Mexico, spanning five years of public data from the INEGI database. Our investigative goal is to unveil the states bearing the brunt of these crimes and to discern the demographic groups most profoundly impacted in terms of gender, age, and educational background. 

Our accessible online dashboard delivers a compelling visual portrayal of the harsh realities adversely affecting the country, utilizing insightful statistical charts. By transforming data into vivid narratives, our goal is to enrich comprehension and stimulate informed discussions about the profound societal challenges presented by homicides in Mexico.
